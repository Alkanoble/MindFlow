## Project Description  
MindFlow is a dynamic thought-processing engine that breaks down math expressions step-by-step and analyzes text inputs with sentiment and intent recognition, making problem solving and introspection interactive and visually engaging.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Ever wished math and text analysis could be as fun and insightful as chatting with a friend? Most tools just spit answers; they don‚Äôt show their thinking or emotions.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
MindFlow solves this by acting like a quirky AI buddy who breaks down your math problems and texts stepwise, giving you a transparent thought process with cool animations and a history of your mental adventures.
